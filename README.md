Rails LTS 3.0
=============

Rails LTS 3.0 is a maintained release of Rails 3.0 that includes additional security fixes.
See [https://railslts.com/](https://railslts.com) for more information.

**Please note that support for Rails 3.0 is scheduled to end on January 1st, 2016.**
After that date we will no longer be able to provide security patches for Rails 3.0.
If you require patches after that date, please either upgrade to Rails LTS 3.2 (a version we support)
or make a special arrangement with us.


Pull Requests
-------------

Since this LTS release focuses on security only, we would ask you to not submit
pull requests with non-essential changes.

If you have found a vulnerability that relates to Rails in general, please check http://rubyonrails.org/security.
If you found something related to LTS only, you can contact us at railslts-maintainers@makandra.de.
